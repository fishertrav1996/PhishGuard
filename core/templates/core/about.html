        <h1>About PhishGuard</h1>

        <p class="mt-4">
            PhishGuard was created in response to the rising number of ransomware attacks targeting hospitals, clinics, 
            and healthcare systems across the United States. Despite improvements in network security, many breaches in 
            healthcare still begin the same way: a staff member receives a malicious email and accidentally interacts with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Healthcare organizations face unique pressures—fast-paced environments, high-value patient data, and staff who 
            often juggle multiple responsibilities. These conditions make phishing one of the most successful attack vectors 
            for threat actors looking to deploy ransomware or compromise critical systems.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Why PhishGuard Exists</h3>
        <p>
            PhishGuard was built to give healthcare organizations a practical way to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Identify phishing-related weaknesses in real-world scenarios</li>
            <li>Educate employees using focused, healthcare-specific training</li>
            <li>Measure improvement over time with clear analytics</li>
            <li>Increase overall resilience to ransomware and email-based attacks</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4">
            By equipping healthcare staff with the awareness and tools needed to recognize malicious emails, PhishGuard 
            helps reduce the likelihood of ransomware events that could disrupt patient care, damage reputation, and create 
            significant financial loss.
