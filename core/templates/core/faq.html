        <h3>How does PhishGuard help prevent ransomware?</h3>
        <p>
            Most ransomware attacks begin with a successful phishing email. 
            PhishGuard helps reduce this risk by training users, sending simulations, 
            and providing analytics on your organization’s susceptibility to email threats.
