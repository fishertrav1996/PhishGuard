   - Store in organized file structure
   - Test with real campaign data

3. **Create Sample Report**
   - Use dummy data
   - Show in marketing materials
   - Get feedback before building

4. **Legal Review**
   - Have attorney review attestation language
   - Ensure we're not promising guaranteed compliance
   - Disclaimer about "tool to assist" not "ensure compliance"

---

## Legal Disclaimers Required

**Important:** PhishGuard reports must include:

> "This report is provided as a tool to assist with security awareness training documentation. It does not guarantee compliance with HIPAA, HITECH, HITRUST, or any other regulatory requirements. Organizations are responsible for their own compliance programs. Consult with legal and compliance professionals regarding your specific regulatory obligations."

**Why:** We're a tool provider, not compliance consultants. Must avoid liability for customer's compliance failures.

---

## Key Metrics to Track (for our own validation)

1. **Customer Usage**
   - How often do they generate reports?
   - Which report types most popular?
   - Do they actually use attestation language?

2. **Sales Impact**
   - Do compliance features increase conversions?
   - Are healthcare orgs willing to pay more?
   - Does this differentiate us from competitors?

3. **Support Requests**
   - What questions do customers ask about reports?
   - What's missing that they need?
   - What's confusing in current format?

---

## Conclusion

**The Value We Provide:**

PhishGuard transforms phishing simulations from "nice to have security exercise" into **documented evidence of HIPAA compliance** that healthcare organizations can present to auditors, insurance providers, and regulators.

We're not just testing employees - we're building the audit trail that proves reasonable safeguards were in place.

**This is the competitive moat for healthcare market.**
